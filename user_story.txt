(constrain: Langone project is heavily theoretical)

As a DNA scientific specialist, I want the protein-to-DNA conversion to gain cross-references from protein study.
Criteria:
1. The accuracy of protein analysis > 95%
2. The domain of protein LLM covers some non-coding DNA.
3. Both protein and DNA scientists can explain the result.

As a clinical geneticist, I want the probability of genetic mutation to make diagonsis and avoid risks.
Criteria:
1. The system could recognize mainstream genetic diseases w.r.t. protein mutation with accuracy > 95%
2. The system should allow user to input their genetic data and provide analysis.
3. Provide clinical report s.t. medical analysists could rely on it.

As an academic researcher, I want the costless reproducibility s.t. people could verify and replicate our work academically.
Criteria:
1. The data source, workflow, platform and users are all available academically.
2. The result of any replicate should have negligible difference compared to this product.
3. Any academic progress based on this project are able to inherit the academic properties of this project.
